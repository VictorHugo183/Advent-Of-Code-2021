# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions to the 2021 Advent of Code challenges.<br>
Each solution is based on a given input file for that particular challenge, inputs are unique to each participant.


## What is Advent of Code?
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like **yes, including JavaScript and Python!!!**
> Every day for 25 days this month you have small programming challenges that you need to solve to complete the "tree". Each day, the questions get a little bit harder to really push you to learn and improve your programming skills. https://adventofcode.com/
